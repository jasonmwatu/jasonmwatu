# Jason Mwatu (Developer)

## About Me
 👋 Hi, I’m @jasonmwatu, a forever learning developer from Kenya 🐱‍🏍
 
 👀 I’m interested in Full-Stack web development

 ✨ I can make beautiful webdesigns in Figma, and pixel perfect frontends with the React Framework
 
 🛠 I can make backends/api's with Django, Laravel and the Slim framework
 
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full-stack projects that are fun, even if they are based on languages/frameworks other than ReactJS, PHP, or JavaScript, which I currently know.
